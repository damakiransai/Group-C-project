                <h2>CAPTAIN</h2>
                <p>Captain Jack Sparrow is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the Pirates of the
                    Caribbean film series and franchise. An early iteration of Sparrow was created by screenwriters Ted
                    Elliott and Terry Rossio, but the final version of the character was created by actor Johnny Depp,
                    who also portrayed him.
                    The characterization of Sparrow is based on a combination of The Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith
                    Richards and Looney Tunes cartoons, specifically the characters Bugs Bunny and Pep√© Le Pew. He first
                    appears in the 2003 film Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. He later appears in
                    the sequels Dead Man's Chest (2006), At World's End (2007), On Stranger Tides (2011), and Dead Men
                    Tell No Tales (2017).

                    <h2>JACK</h2>
                    <p>In films, Sparrow is one of the nine pirate lords in the Brethren Court, the Pirate Lords of
                        the Seven Seas. He can survives mostly by using wit and negotiation rather
                        than by force, opting to flee most dangerous situations and to fight only when necessary.
                        Sparrow is introduced seeking to regain his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate
                        Hector Barbossa. After succeeding, he attempts to escape his blood debt to legendary Davy
                        Jones while fighting the East India Trading Company. Later, when searching for the Fountain of
                        Youth, he is abducted and taken upon Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge and is forced to lead him
                        to the Fountain while the Black Pearl is trapped in a bottle.

                        The Pirates of the Caribbean series was inspired by the Disney theme park ride of the same name,
                        and when the ride was revamped in 2006, the character of Captain Jack Sparrow was added to it.
                        He headlined the Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios, and is
                        the subject of spin-off novels, including a children's book series, Pirates of the Caribbean:
                        Jack Sparrow, which chronicles his childhood years.For the song by The Lonely Island featuring Michael Bolton,
